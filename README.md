# EthProofAssessment
#Metacrafters in this challenge, i have created a token and then deploy it.

I use following function:
(i). A mint() function to generate certain amount token at a particular ethereum address.
(ii). A burn() function to burn certain amount of token at a particular ethereum address.

I learn the following things from this course:
(i). How to make smart contract and deploy them.
(ii). Learn about gas price, and multiple operations in solidity.
(iii). for every operation like mint, burn and transfer we should need a address.
